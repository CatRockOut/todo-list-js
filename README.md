### Description:
This project is a simple todo list application built using JavaScript. Users can create, edit, delete, and save tasks, with the list of tasks being stored in cookies for persistence.

### Functionality:
1. **Adding Tasks:**
   - Users can input a task and click the large green "Save" button to add it to the list. However, the task is not saved permanently until the user clicks the small green square "Save" button next to the task.

2. **Saving Tasks:**
   - Clicking the small green square "Save" button next to a task saves it to the cookies, ensuring that it persists even after closing the application.
   
3. **Deleting Tasks:**
   - Each task has a small red circular "Delete" button next to it, allowing users to remove tasks from the list and delete them from the cookies.

4. **Bulk Delete:**
   - At the bottom of the list, there is a button "Clean Items" to delete all tasks at once. This clears both the list and the cookies.

5. **Editing Tasks:**
   - Users can edit a task by clicking on its text. This transfers the task to the input field, where users can modify the text. Clicking the red "Edit" button, which appears when editing, confirms the changes. However, the edited task needs to be saved again to the cookies by clicking the small green square "Save" button.

### Usage:
To use the todo list application:
1. Enter a task in the input field.
2. Click the large "Save" button to add the task to the list.
3. To save the task permanently, click the small square "Save" button next to the task.
4. To delete a task, click the small circular "Delete" button next to it.
5. To delete all tasks, click the "Clean Items" button at the bottom.
6. To edit a task, click on its text, make the desired changes, and click the "Edit" button.
